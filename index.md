This is a guide to a "top" pre-doctoral research position, intended for Middlebury College students. Predoc recruiting, as potentially most other jobs, suffer heavily from information asymmetry. This document aims to reduce this barrier for aspiring Middlebury students relative to their counterparts at top research universities. 

Expressed are my personal opinions. Many of them will not be the optimal advice for you, depending on your personal circumstances. I strongly recommend reading in consultation with your faculty mentors who know your situation, before acting on any of my advice.  

## This Guide's Credibility
When I studied at Harvard, I worked with predocs at top programs like David Yang's lab and Melissa Dell's lab. I applied to 15 predoc positions, landed 2 job offers including Jesse Shapiro's lab by early October. I also scheduled interviews with Amy Finkelstein and Blueprint Labs before withdrawing. My advice in this document mostly comes from my personal experiences, reading online, and conversations with my connections and faculty mentors. 




## "Top" Predoc Programs?
**Definition**: While "top" is subjective and goal-dependent, here I narrowly define top pre-docs as the pipelines to top 7 economics departments. Some of them have median placement in top 7 Economics PhD programs. 
**Examples** of top predoc programs may include but are surely not limited to: 
- MIT Blueprint Lab
- MIT: Amy Finkelstein
- MIT J-PAL
- Dartmouth: Heidi Williams
- Harvard: Melissa Dell, Claudia Goldin, Jesse Shapiro, David Yang
- Harvard Opportunity Insights (OI)
- Federal Reserve New York City
- Microsoft Research
- Stanford SIEPR: Matthew Gentzkow
- Stanford GSB: Susan Athey, Guido Imbens
- Princeton Industrial Relations Section
- Chicago Booth: Pascal Noel
- Chicago BFI: Magne Mogstad, Alexander Torgovitsky

Non-top predocs also place researchers into top programs, although less frequent. 


### Why a top predoc program may not be for you
- If you are not committed to pursing an Economics PhD yet, you may prefer some general-purpose programs
  - Examples include research positions at think tanks, law schools, economic consulting firms, quantitative positions at banks or hedge funds, and data science positions in tech / retail industry
  - In these positions, those who end up not pursing an Economics PhD still land on other good graduate programs / think tanks / law school / data scientist / economic consulting / other industry jobs
  - On the other hand, some top predoc programs are solely for placing into Economics PhDs; they may fare badly as springboards to other positions
- A "top" predoc does not necessarily maximize your learning / treatment effect on human capital for you, due to both selection bias and treatment effect heterogeneity
- A "top" Economics program may not matter as much to you in life. 
  - Many do great work without going to a top school
    - John List went to U Wisconsin for undergrad and U of Wyoming for PhD 
    - My mentor at Middlebury, Akhil Rao, one of the smartest people I know, went to CU Boulder for PhD
  - By contrast, many graduates of MIT/Harvard PhD programs quit academia or even quit PhD. 
  - It all depends on what your goals are in life.
