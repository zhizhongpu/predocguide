## Epistemological Notes
When I studied at Harvard, I worked with predocs at David Yang's and Melissa Dell's labs. In 2023, I applied to 15 predoc positions, got 2 job offers, including Jesse Shapiro's lab, by early October. I also scheduled interviews with Amy Finkelstein and Blueprint Labs before withdrawing. This document's content mostly comes from my personal experiences, reading online, and conversations with my many helpful connections and faculty mentors.
