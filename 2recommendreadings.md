I find advice in these readings helpful, but in this document I will rarely repeat anything already addressed in these readings, so make sure you read them. 

## General-purpose Advice
- [Econ RA Guide](https://raguide.github.io/)
- Susan Athey, A*dvice for Applying to Grad School in Economics*
- Jesse Shapiro, *Notes on Applying for a PhD in Economics*

## On Writing Thesis / Research Paper
- Plamen Nikolov, *Writing Tips for Economics Research Papers*
  - This is the thesis guide for Harvard Economics thesis students
- Jesse Shapiro, *Four Steps to an Applied Micro Paper*
- Jesse Shapiro, *How to Give an Applied Micro Talk: Unauthoritative Notes*
- Deirdre McCloskey, *Economical Writing*. I don't consider the full text necessary. A summary should suffice.

## On Coding / Data Work
- Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, *Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide*
- Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, [Internal RA Manual](https://github.com/gslab-econ/lab-manual/wiki)
