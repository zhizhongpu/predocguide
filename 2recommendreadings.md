# 2. Recommend Readings
I find advice in these readings helpful, but in this document I will rarely repeat anything already addressed in these readings, so make sure you read them. 

## General-purpose Advice
- [Econ RA Guide](https://raguide.github.io/)
- Susan Athey, A*dvice for Applying to Grad School in Economics*
- Jesse Shapiro, *Notes on Applying for a PhD in Economics*

## On Writing Thesis / Research Paper
- Plamen Nikolov, *Writing Tips for Economics Research Papers*
  - This is the thesis guide for Harvard Economics thesis students
- Jesse Shapiro, *Four Steps to an Applied Micro Paper*
- Jesse Shapiro, *How to Give an Applied Micro Talk: Unauthoritative Notes*
- Deirdre McCloskey, *Economical Writing*. I don't consider the full text necessary. A summary should suffice.

## On Coding / Data Work
- Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, *Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide*
- Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, [Internal RA Manual](https://github.com/gslab-econ/lab-manual/wiki)

# 3. Before Applying
## Courses 
**What to take**: The best list of courses may depend on your field of interest. You should start with this list and consult your faculty mentors.
- Empirical Research Methods
- Applied Econometrics
- Regression Analysis / Regression 
- Advanced Real Analysis Seminar / Real Analysis
- Advanced Macro Theory / Macro Theory
- Micro Theory
- Advanced Probability Seminar / Measure Theory
- Probability
- Statistical Inference 
- Statistical Learning / Machine Learning
- Intro to Computing
- Data Structures
- Elementary Topology
- Linear Algebra
- Multi-variable Calculus
- Differential Equations
- An Economics CW course
- Any other coursework in Math, Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science

What about field courses in economics? Valuable they might be for your learning and undergraduate research, they are not as valued by PIs of top predoc programs except for those specific to some programs (e.g. a health economics class could benefit your application to Amy Finkelstein's lab). Field courses with more math and more academic papers may help you more.     

**Sequence**: 
- Consider taking the most challenging and "useful" / "practical" coursework as early as possible to help you get research opportunities
  - Personal experience: In my 2nd year a PI at Brookings commented on the fact that I was already taking real analysis during an interview, and it might have factored in the offer he made me eventually. (For reference, however, you may wish to know that many students at Harvard take real analysis as part of their first math course - that is just how math classes there are structured)
- Some courses are offered only once every few years. You should try your best to do them as early as possible, by taking the pre-reqs early or talking to the instructor.

## Gain Research Experience 
To: 
- build your CV
- learn and practice how (best) to do research
- develop relationships with potential future letter-writers
- gain (potentially long-term) mentorship
- learn about different fields of social science
- develop ideas for your own thesis / independent research

Similar to some other jobs like IBD and consulting, a common career ladder is: part-time RA → full-time summer RA → predoc, where the scale of project, your contributions, and the name recognizability of your PIs increase along the path

### Part-time / Semester RA @Midd
- Part-time semester RA positions at Middlebury usually require little or no prior research experience. 
  - Core economics courses and coding skills in Stata and R make you competitive
- Due to search cost, not all info about semester RA positions is posted publicly. 
  - You should reach out to professors privately
- At this stage, you should take on projects with maximal learning opportunities and good PIs
  - Your interest in the field / topic should be secondary
- You may also consider RA positions in the statistics or political science department

### Part-time RA Outside Middlebury
- Some PIs run large labs with many part-time RAs who help with manual / dirty work
  - These PIs tend to be prominent researchers with many projects and thus labor demand
  - e.g. Melissa Dell and David Yang
- These positions usually require more skills than an average part-time RA position @Midd
- You should expect no pay
- How much you gain depends on your contribution
  - Part-time RAs usually report directly to pre-docs, and many part-time RAs make insignificant contributions
  - Personal experience: I know someone who became a PI's part-time RA by cold emailing and eventually co-authored as the sole first author a paper with the PI
  - Work for someone whose work excites you


How to find opportunities:
- Visit the PIs' personal website
  - Some PIs explicitly state on their websites that they hire part-time RAs
- Check out the PIs' Twitter - some post there
- Check out centralize postings such as predoc.org / Econ RA Twitter
- Cold email PIs whose work interests you. 
  - You should write a sincere and concise (1 paragraph) email explaining your interest and highlight your skills. 
    - Consider this email as a cover letter where you have 10s to make the reader want to learn about you more
  - Attach your CV, transcripts, writing sample, and code samples
  - Expect most PIs to not respond. Thank those who say no. You should keep on cold-emailing, but don't over-do it. You may look bad if you got multiple offers but then had to turn most down
- Use Middlebury's alumni network
  - A few alumni in the past two decades ara now professors at top research institutions, and more alumni are current PhD students
  - You should connect to them and see if they have or can refer you to any opportunities.  

### Summer RA @Midd
Around March or April, the Economics department hires summer RAs
You should apply asap with your CV, transcripts, writing sample, and code samples

### Summer research outside Midd
- There are many summer research opportunities outside Middlebury
- These can be quite competitive, with slight variation across programs
  - A good rule of thumb: if any past Middlebury students have done it, then perhaps you can too
- Formal summer positions are mostly paid
- Applications open any time from late-autumn to late-winter

How to find these opportunities? You should certainly look up on the internet, but there are 2 easier ways: asking the economics faculty - they know their students and their colleagues' students - and chatting with alumni. With a few conversations, these two ways allow you to compile a long list of positions that Middlebury students can typically get into.

There are also informal summer research positions that you could get from cold-emailing PIs. They are most likely unpaid, but Middlebury's CCI has funding for you if you phrase this as a research internship

- You may get a summer 0555 credit for external summer research that results in concrete deliverables (a paper or at least a slide deck)
  - At this moment I might be the only person in recent history to have taken advantage of this, and Jeffrey Carpenter helped me. You should contact him if you are interested.

## Read (Lots Of) Papers
A good researcher is creative, but where does creativity come from? You may be a genius and simply create from the void, but that is hard for me. Instead, I gain creativity from reading lots of papers, from which I learnt about new data sources, methodology, common arguments, theory concepts, ways to measure / quantify conceptual variables, and questions that were / are being asked by economists. 

Reading may be hard at the beginning, but it goes easier as you read more, because you come across more familiar concepts and are able to connect unfamiliar ones to familiar ones. This is a long term effort. 

Here are some opportunities:
- Follow NBER / IZA / economics journals on LinkedIn / Twitter / Instagram. Fill your social media with interesting papers
- Sign up for research summary emails from institutions like J-PAL or HBS
- MiddEcon invites external speakers to give talks and talk with students. Sign up for a lunch if possible and attend their research talks
- Join MiddEcon's economics student advisory committee (SAC) to have free lunch with visiting candidates to interview at MiddEcon
- Ask MiddEcon faculty for lunch, offered for free at MiddDining
- External opportunities for talks. For example, Harvard has its [seminar series](https://economics.harvard.edu/seminars-workshops), the majority of which is steamed on zoom
- [Econimate](https://www.youtube.com/@econimate) on Youtube

If you are new to the economics literature, sometimes reading research summary books may be better than straight going to cutting-edge literature. This is because books are more structured and systematic, so they can give you a fuller picture of the field, while a paper usually focuses on a narrow aspect. Also, books are usually more tailored to a less technical audience. Examples of books include:
- S. Dubner and S. Levitt, *Freakonomics*
- D. Acemoglu and J. Robinson, *Why nations fail*
- D. Acemoglu and J. Robinson, *The Narrow Corridor*
- D. Acemoglu and S. Johnson, *Power and Progress*
- D. Acemoglu and D. Autor, *Lectures in Labor Economics*
- C. Goldin, *The Race between Education and Technology*
- A. Banerjee and E. Duflo, *Poor Economics*
- A. Banerjee and E. Duflo, *Good Economics for Hard Times*
- A. Case and A. Deaton, *Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism*
- J. Angrist and S. Pishcke, *Mastering Metrics*
- D. Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*



## Networking
This is one of the most important skills in your life. You learn about the job, the application processes (including how to write good CV / cover letters), and get some insider information (e.g. which PIs to avoid, what's in the job interview, what are good opportunities, past placement, etc.)

Learn networking and cold-calling / cold-emailing. Connect with alumni and strangers on LinkedIn and ask them about their jobs / PhD programs. Follow people on Twitter. Learn how to leverage existing connections (including professors) to make new connections.

If you have trouble learning / doing these on your own, instead of not doing them, you should reach out to CCI for help, or even participate in MiddCORE to practice.

## Transfer / Study Away 
Conditions permitting, you should consider transferring to / studying / exchanging at institutions of top economics departments / rigorous academic trainings in Math, Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science, including but not limited to:
  - Any US institutions with a top Economics department
  - LSE / Oxbridge
  - Stockholm School of Economics
  - Swarthmore College (Middlebury's official study away program)

These institutions tend to offer more advanced classes (e.g. graduate classes, advanced real analysis, proof-heavy math classes) and their grades are more recognizable.

## Feb Yourself
Most predocs start in early summer, but some PIs will prefer candidates who can start earlier. Being a Feb does not hurt and sometimes is an advantage, so do it if possible.

# 3. Applying
## Apply Early
Top positions open early. Many recruit on a rolling basis. For the rolling ones, an early application is a non-trivial advantage due to the high search cost (of reviewing data tasks and interviews). Have the following documents ready (i.e. written, reviewed by faculty / alumni / peers, rewritten, and proofread 3+ times on different days) by late August: 
- CV
- Annotated transcripts
- Generic cover letter
- Writing sample / thesis
- A coding sample for each language you know
- 2~3 recommendation letters
  - Some recommenders WILL wait until the very last minute to write you a letter
    - Personal experience: I know someone who made it to / past the final interview but missed the job because their letter was submitted too late
  - Around mid-late summer, send over to your recommenders 
    - all your application materials 
    - a list of positions you are applying to, along with the JD and how and by when to submit letters
    - a list of your highlights / most significant research contributions / examples of your best qualities as a researcher 
  - After that, you should regularly (e.g. weekly) check in gently with your letter writers to make sure they are on track and answer any of their questions

## No Typos
Typos signal bad "attention to detail", which some PIs value. The lack thereof leads researchers to make stupid mistakes that could cost days or weeks to fix, and it undermines the credibility of their research work and code. 

## Make Slides for Your Thesis
- You will almost always be asked about your thesis / independent research projects during interviews. A slide deck helps you present your thesis clearly and professionally
- If you have 0 independent research projects, makes slides for the RA project to which you contributed the most

## Craft a Cover Letter Friendly to HRs
Depending on the position, your cover letter may be first screened by an HR with little quantitative background. The HR may have so many applications to review that they look for excuses to throw away yours. Don't give them any excuse to. Don't throw economics jargon everywhere - nobody will eventually read your jargons if the HR trashes your application. Be sincere and show your interest in the position. Ask your roommate majoring in studio arts to read it, and re-write until they feel compelled to hire / interview you.
Personal experience: in my junior year I applied to lots of summer RA positions with an insincere and poorly crafted cover letter full of technical jargons. I received only one offer and 0 other interviews, despite my advanced classes at Harvard and extensive RA experience.
Bottom line: even if you could tell the counterfactual of every factual in the world, nobody cares unless the HR gives you a pass.

## Annotate Your Transcripts
Middlebury's transcript is not the clearest, and some top predocs (e.g. Amy Finkelstein) seek details of your courses not conveyed by the standard transcript. Annotate it to include your class year for each semester, textbooks used for each important class, alternative course names, etc. 

## Connect To Other Applicants
Competitive candidates usually get multiple offers. Some star candidates, when turning down offers, may express their appreciation to the offering PI by referring the job to their connections.
Personal experience: I know someone who got referred to, and eventually received an offer from, a top predoc from his friend who declined the offer.
